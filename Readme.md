## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTML5 UP

This is an apartment-focused website created using a template from HTML5UP. The website showcases the apartment services, providing information about the units, amenities, and the prices.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

When I improve this project, I will make a separate page where a customer can see if the unit is available for rent, the costs for it, and all the details needed. 

## Lessons Learned:

User-Centric Design: Prioritize a user-friendly experience by simplifying navigation and ensuring clear calls to action.

Analytics-Driven Decisions: Utilize analytics tools early on to gather insights into user behavior, shaping informed design choices and content strategies.
